This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

INITIAL SETUP
1)  confirm you have both node.js and node package manager installed
    -   npm -v
    -   node -v
2)  clone the repository
4)  navigate to your directory in command line
3)  set up dependencies
    -   npm install
5)  if neccecary, follow instructions in your command line to audit and repair vaunerabilities
6)  if neccecary, set up your mysql database (see later item)
7)  modify @/getPort.tsx and @/connectToDb.tsx to reflect your local development enviorment

DEVELOPMENT
-    npm run dev -> localhost:3000
-    npm run dev_live -> localhost:8080, our live port

these enviorments refresh as you save making them ideal for development, however the live inturpretation/compiling of your code causes them to operate slowly.

SHIPPING / DEPLOYING:
1)  build/compile the code using the npm inturpreter
        npm run build
2)  run the compiled code in a forked process
        pm2 start deploy.json
3)  wait a few seconds then check to ensure that there have been no errors in our task
        pm2 list

DATABASE
the only other dependency you have to set up is our database, formatted as follows:
-   dayratereport
- -     users
- - -       username    varchar(255)
- - -       password    varchar(255)
- - -       uid         varchar(255)
